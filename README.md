# Impact Regression

#### This project was done as a Graduate Assistant at UGA's Small Business Development Center. Using panel data on clients, I estimated a regression using Fixed Effects to determine the effect of consulting hours on sales. The purpose of using Fixed Effects was to account for the time-invariant client characteristics that are unobservable and unmeasureable.
